Any other questions?
No.
So Peter, that's all for me.

Colin & Madelene Lauw   32:14
Sorry, Peter, you want to talk about the country you bought for the the slide, the time starts that.

peter tseng   32:20
Yes, yes.
OK, OK uh before the.
OK, nice.
Two part.
The first one is a country report.
I think that the everybody, every, every member, is just prepare the country's report and I discussed with the Korean earlier and maybe we can have a some kind of conversation about it.
Presentation of the the way of a presentation of come of national report.
Why?
Initially, I hope the kid was designed.
The another way to to to ask everybody have a more discussion about the national report, especially exchange the and you know the feeding or the feedback about the uh, others national report.
But I don't think that.
Do we have enough time to discuss that before the conference?
So maybe we have a a option here.
We can discuss it more about the should we present further in the conference about the detail of the national report or we just have another meeting to discuss the they change our uh feedback about our national report, maybe a beginning of next month and then after the next meeting we can conclude something that will something like a we were better interesting at some topic for the for from other countries.

Osmand Fernando   33:50
Yeah, no.
Ingest killer.
Kiss, kiss, kiss.

peter tseng   34:20
So.
Why did it depends on everybody's, we we have, we have to decide which way do we we should take in the conference.
So everybody good thing to what I'm talking about.

Colin & Madelene Lauw   34:46
Yeah. So.
So OK.
So we prepared a I think the team minute video as our national report.

peter tseng   34:58
Yeah.

Colin & Madelene Lauw   35:01
And that's only for actually the leaders, right?
So that you can listen and read our report and maybe have some questions and comment about it.

peter tseng   35:10
Yes.

Colin & Madelene Lauw   35:13
Now I know that would take a long time I think.

peter tseng   35:14
Yes.
Yes.

Colin & Madelene Lauw   35:18
And other countries may ask US questions about 30 million report.
I will ask some questions about Indonesia's report and all that, so I know that he will take another meeting to do this.
But I actually we don't have so much time.
For what?
What are we going to do about the 20 minutes that you give us for our national reporting in the conference?
I think if you ask each country to give 20 minutes to report, this was done in 2010, 2013 and I think 20, oh, eight and it was not very good.
It is not helpful because I remember very clearly 2010, 2013.
We have 20 minutes, so with ourselves we will talk for 10 minutes and we answer questions for 10 minutes.
In the end, we thought for 15 minutes and then the cat say, OK, you have 5 minutes to ask questions.
So wanna do brave young people will ask some question about our national report and then we give them one minute answer and then finish.

peter tseng   36:34
Yeah, yeah, I agree.

Colin & Madelene Lauw   36:34
And so.
So then then one of the feedback is I wanted to know more, but I have no time because after the national report now we go to another report, another report and then we go for math and then we go for spiritual input session or very good.
But I want to know more about Taiwan something or you know some people ask this question so, so.
But yes, I know some other people who are only observer.
They, they, they, they, they are.
They're OK because they only want to have the fellowship and which is very important, and they want to have the the spiritual input, which they will have, but those who want to know a bit more, like for example, I remember, I was very curious to know more about Sri Lanka, how you do this for the parents and a few things, but I don't have time to ask.
So so then.
Later in later years, other choice conferences we said, OK, we do what the other conferences in so many conferences you're attend, right, they have this thing called break out session.
So after the the the speakers give the truth here and the speakers give the normal thought the input right.
Then after that they say OK, now we will have a session where we have four.
We have break out.
So you choose which one you want to go and attend.
So maybe one session is about.
I don't know.
Something you know?
So.
So that's why I I imagine if you have a breakout session about parent program then maybe one person from choice Singapore will attend because maybe it's interesting we see how we can learn from you, right.
But maybe at the same time there another input and that input is about Hong Kong saying, you know, we are our young people are so busy and we have to change our program a bit because they're so busy and now they're so social media, everything is shortcut, shortcut, shortcut.
So we will tell you our problem.
We will tell you our challenges and we tell you how we how we change a little bit.
Then Singapore say well, Jesus, I raised my hands in Singapore.
Say I we we have the same problem.
Our people are busy, our people.
Maybe Friday night.
They don't want to come or I don't know.
What?
NOT they.
They only can come for two days.
So now, instead of 3132 nights, we did so we we will go at 10 and see what is the maybe similar problem and so then we can have one hour and we can talk maybe if if you need to OK maybe Hong Kong and Singapore, yeah, I hope problem then we have a small sharing which Hong Kong, Singapore and then maybe Taiwan want to observe.
OK, than can send some people and then you talk, talk, talk, talk, talk.
Then there's a lot of talking about this problem, but then there's no answer.
Right, because you need to one hour.
Let's say you need what your breakout session.
We need one hour, but never mind.
Now is the Internet world right now with COVID?
Now you know we can talk online, Ken.
So after the conference, we say, OK.
Hong Kong.
I won Singapore.
We have same problem.
Let us talk.
See.
See what we can maybe we can help each other.
Yeah.
And then we we can see, Singapore said we want to do something about whatever.
Yeah.
Then maybe another another country.
Say we we want to share about the top five.
Top five is big, big issue.
We had to change top five but we don't know whether it is against instant Constitution and I don't know why.
Don't know what or we have to change, right?
You have to change the content a bit so then Singapore will be interested because we are we are telling ourselves we have to change some more.
We change a bit already.
We change already a bit early, we now for top five we have to have input we our our our the couple actually give some kind of like input not just like the other thoughts where it's just sharing only sharing.
Ohh so we wish we can share that if you want to and then then.
But it's not the it's not the best thing, but we we just share and then we talk and then again if they find it interesting, then we will, we will.
Online for the next one year.
Two years we work together and you share something now.
So that was my idea that the this national reports can instead become breakout session now so that we can the leaders can talk more deeply.
And then, of course, the future leaders.
Some of them are there right?
Some of the future leaders are coming at us as observers.
They can also share and talk, and then something can happen.
Yeah.
So I I don't think to agree on this, but we don't need to.
We don't need to wait for the next meeting and have each country say this is my presentation.
What do you think?
And everyone asks a lot of questions.
I don't think we need to.
I I think we can quickly quite quickly decide one of the topic is ( 1 of the topic is top five one.
The topic is top, you know, and then we we we will, we will raise our hand, we say OK I I will try to facilitate that means it's not you're not giving the question and the answer to the problem right you only saying we have this problem so we will facilitate we will we will have a discussion and we will facilitate this.
So on that day, if the timing is day three, season four, OK, we will facilitate day three.
Sachin four, we want to talk about this like this.
What do you think then?
Then there's more good thinking and good talking about, uh, the challenge of a choice, the challenge of our topics, the challenge of our society.

peter tseng   42:52
OK.
Thank you, Corinne.
Well, basically I think it is interesting, but how about the opinion of the every country?
Do you have another idea?

Frank   43:07
Uh, I'm Frankie from Malaysia.
I seconded Collins idea on the reports.
This is my first time joining Asia reports and during our Choice national reports we will have this the this repeated idea on how the reports look like and then most of the time it is such a waste of time we learn, we learn almost nothing and then the problem that arise on our our our weekend keep continuing.
So I don't think the report, I don't think we we should spend time on reports.
Instead, maybe maybe you can distribute the report to every country and let them have a look, and then during the day itself, we don't need to.
We don't need to.
We don't need to go to the report again, but if if there is any question from respective country on the report, they will always can us you know how come this and how come that so that we can save a little bit of time on the on what can we do on moving forward like what Colin sets Singapore have different ideas on parent session for example and then 4th topics 5 that I think on on our on our pecks especially in Malaysia I don't see I don't see any anything on the on what is going on.
Now, like currently in in, in, in the whole world, especially especially on LGBTQ, we if if we can discuss something like that you know I for for brighter and for uh for more understanding on on on on how are we going to tackle that particular issue for example because of the the kids nowadays they are they they are more brave they are more open so how are we going to tackle this this issue and then uh make it into our topic 5 for example so I don't think we should spend like 10 minutes after present our.
Report, but instead, maybe you can forward the report to each country.
Then we can have a look just if we have any question we can ask on the days of, but rather I think I would agree with what everything that Colin said I like.
I would like to have that breakout session and then what we can do to improve our weekend the quality of the weekends and what what?
A new learnings that we can adapt from each country to make our experience better for new, newer generations.
That's from me.

peter tseng   46:00
OK.
Thank you, Frank.
Any other anybody else?

Frank   46:02
Yep.

peter tseng   46:22
So if if there is no other opinion, I would recommend that we can have a table to invite some kind of a topic from every country and then the baby.
You can you can also recommend which country is better to present this topic.
So we will combine the everybody's the opinion and then finalized the the each breakout session.
OK.
Can we do that?
So.
So maybe tomorrow or after tomorrow I will prepare the Excel sheet or be body to fill out the topic or the interest.
Interesting.
Anything from you?
And then we can exchange our idea, OK.

Colin & Madelene Lauw   47:28
Juliana, you say a father is going to give input on TOB, right?

office cac   47:36
No 2B is actually given by another person who is in charge of the TB.

Colin & Madelene Lauw   47:39
Oh oh.

office cac   47:40
Yeah, Father will be giving the the CHRISTUS with it.

Colin & Madelene Lauw   47:46
Ohk.
OK.

office cac   47:48
Yep.

Colin & Madelene Lauw   47:48
So, but it's just that it's is is good that there is this, the OB specialist who will give input, right.

office cac   47:58
Yes.

Colin & Madelene Lauw   48:00
So.
But it's only input right after that.
There's no big discussion.
It's just input, right?

office cac   48:07
We will have a breakup room.
There's a a quick one, yeah.

Colin & Madelene Lauw   48:10
Ohh personal uh sharings about ohh.

office cac   48:14
Yes. Uh.

Colin & Madelene Lauw   48:16
So then to me, Peter, one natural topic, I don't know whether Malaysia is the one to, to to be leading the the the to facilitate that would be a breakout session on like OK now that we are because during that week we will be listening to TOB, those of us who know we want, we will be revising our thoughts about the OB, then those of us who want is new then then is good.
They have some new input, but the main thing is we are thinking about uh, DOB and what sex all about now.
So one of the breakouts could be about.
OK, so now they understand it better.
But you know we can't do the whole 3 OB in 2 1/2 hours in the choice weekend.
So then it's more like the breakout is about, OK, so for the 2 1/2 hours in a choice weekend, what should we cover and what should we try to achieve that?
So for example, we we don't have to achieve how to reply to the whole thing about LGBT, because actually to me, I think Taiwan is more expert than Taiwan has already started.
So, but The thing is, I always try not to say too much about that because actually we need 2 1/2 hours.
So if we talk LGBT, then we will, we will not be talking about love and about the whole idea about thanks.
Thanks.
Before Mary, sex after marriage, all, all that we won't talk about because we we are talking about gender already.
So then, so maybe the breakout session would be about, what is it that young adults want to hear, NOT about LGBT and gender, but what is it they want to hear about love, about dating, about marriage, about sexual, and then maybe that's just a discussion.
And at the end of day, after the discussion, each entry or each can go back and say, OK, I think we got a clearer idea how we can improve our 2 1/2 hours of top five.
Then over the one, there's one or two years I can imagine different different.
Countries may have studied different things.
They emphasize different things, but maybe at the end of day it's still the same purpose, right?
So so maybe I'm just being one of the breakouts that I don't know which country.
Maybe it's Malaysia because Malaysia is the one, because maybe that TOP person can be there.
I'm not sure.
Then, then, then, then you are start.
You already started your workshop.
One how we can talk about. Yeah.
So then part of the OB that will be good for our 2 1/2 hours of that choice, we can.
Yeah, a lot.
I mean, it's just an idea.
There's one topic there.
They actually for Singapore actually we had talked about this before.
So we say, OK for Singapore, if if the conference wants us to have a breakout and talk about something we said, we just talk about our shopping guidelines.
So that's in our video recording our workshopping guidelines.
Because we of course we still use the the original document to guide and.
Show a new presenters what to what, what to share, what to write about.
But because that that the that the original document is so old.
So we decide we don't change the document is is not so good to change the document, but we add something else.
So that's why we have for workshops, guy.
But the workshop for the senior person really knows what is the new changes.
And then he will say to the young adult, OK.
Yes, yes, correct.
Yeah, but this.
This is your today problem today challenges.
And you're right, this is what that you can share about for talk to.
You're right, this is what you can share about for top 6.
Some of the sharing is exactly the same As for two years ago, so then it's a bit different, right?
So that's why we started having this 30 page workshops guideline.
So so Singapore said, OK, if we have break out, this is the topic we will we will share and then we maybe learn from other workshops also who might want to attend that that session because they also have other maybe other other resources that they are using to to make sure that they are always consistent always say yeah so there's my All input.

peter tseng   53:03
Yeah, baby, baby, baby.

Colin & Madelene Lauw   53:03
Immanuel.
Anything to add?

peter tseng   53:07
No, I think that he will be.
There is a big topic, so maybe later I I will discuss with Korean probability probability and OK and I think there's a.
For me, I think that we we should we still have one thing to to to review this and his team meeting meeting meeting on the day four.
OK, let me show you the I I remember I give you the proposal of the nation entity meeting, right?
Let me show you the email.

Fernando Rev. Dr. Jude Nicholas Jude Nicholas   54:19

peter tseng   55:16
Currently sits right.
Hello corrine.
It is the first thing we have to do.
The seduction election of the next cat.

No better.

peter tseng   55:45

Hello I think the first things we have to do is next cat election, right?
Hello, corrine.

Colin & Madelene Lauw   55:57
Hello I I don't know.
I've never been cat.
I remember.
Yes, a doing that.
If you just look at the, maybe the 202016, I think that's the sequence 2016 has a minutes, right?
So 2016 CAC the Minutes was there's a cat election, in other words, of who?
Who will is is the next person on the roster agreeable to be the next kadner.
So for 2016, honk if I remember right, Jeannie, you can correct me, but the.
In the beginning, hot Hong Kong was quite concerned about becoming venue holds.
This is in 2013.
Then they say we are.
We are very small community, so in the end after they discuss I remember the meeting, then they they're very brave.
They said we we say we can.
We will host the next uh, according to the roster, according to the timing roster, we will be the next.
The next uh venue?
Then they asked about.
So the but they did say from the beginning, but we are very concerned because the roster means after posting CAC, the next cat is the host of the last CAC.
So they said the next time we we we cannot be.
They told us from the beginning.
So.
So that's why in Hong Kong, hot cat is Hong Kong during the NOT meeting, everyone said Hong Kong.
Thank you so much.
Well done, well done.
And then we then we ask Hong Kong, have you decided in Hong Kong yet?
Yes, we, we cannot be.
Uh, God.
The continue to be we cannot be the the cat now.
That's why Indonesia.
On the road to be cat for three more years.
Then there, she said we we we will accept.
But otherwise, normally whose country is ask first choice first country?
Will you like to be?
Can you confirm that you can be the next cat?
Yeah.
So in this case, now you can ask.
Now we can ask choice Malaysia, are they alright?
If they are the next Peter, yeah.

peter tseng   58:46
Yeah, I mean, I mean the, the I remember that we have a some kind of discussion about the new cat should be join the HT meeting.
Because the we also mentioned about that we we we hope that we can have some kind of uh ohh.
Smooth change for something like that.
So we we we invite next cat into the meeting, right?

Colin & Madelene Lauw   59:25
So what was?
I mean, like you, what we invited into the meeting at in Taiwan by Cat Indonesia, I I kind of I cannot remember.

peter tseng   59:32
Well, I yeah.
Yeah, because last time there it it is.
It didn't doing this way, but I think we we we did discuss it before about the this kind of sequence, yeah.

Colin & Madelene Lauw   59:43
Ohh.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Ohh yes, kiss.
Yeah, I think it's a good idea.
For continuity is sounds very meaningful, yes.
Or at least some representative if if the country say we are not sure who's going to be the cat team, then at least some representative team has to attend, not the national coordinator.
Some can be it can be a senior person, it can be.
I don't know.
And then.
No, they I think Peter suggesting that if possible, the person that's possibly going to be the.
Newcat team should attempt so.
Of course, in in in Taiwan.
Uh, that one Council member was in attendance, but is better if at least one member of the CAT team attends a cat team.
Normally Greece, the religious religious priests or and US and the young adult and a couple, right?

peter tseng   1:01:13
Trouble. Yeah.

Colin & Madelene Lauw   1:01:13
So at least one of them hopefully can be confirmed before the next entity so that they attend the as city meeting.

peter tseng   1:01:16
Yes.
Mm-hmm.

Colin & Madelene Lauw   1:01:24
That's that's your your suggestion is that is that what I understand, Peter?

peter tseng   1:01:26
Yeah, yeah, yes.

Colin & Madelene Lauw   1:01:29
Yeah, I I don't know.
I I support it, but what do they?
Have this thing, yeah.

peter tseng   1:01:34
Yeah.
I'll yeah, Malaysia.

Frank   1:01:38
Uh, we actually have elected our Council member for the next term.
So if if the cat new cat team from Malaysia, they haven't decided we will have representative for this new consult umbrella, I think it shouldn't be a problem.

peter tseng   1:01:58
OK.
Thank you.
In the Hong Kong, do we have any objection?

Ginnie Chan   1:02:06
No, because actually because I'm I have also reported on the national report that because of the the new wave of migration, the active choices in Hong Kong actually is less than 8.
We all of them, all the families, Francis at everyone that have already, they're all in UK or in Canada, all of them.
Many families are couples, singles, all all left.
So wait for active choices to to organize the Cam.
Actually, less than eight people in Hong Kong.
So I think it is quite difficult for us to be the cat at this moment.
We are trying to and train up some some new helpers, but the they're working youth actually they are really not.
Not very into the training section to be the helper.
So we are trying trying our best.

peter tseng   1:03:17
OK, so don't worry about that.
The way you I think the we we we already have a Malaysia where take over the Netscape.

Ginnie Chan   1:03:25
Yeah.
Yeah, I totally agree with Malaysia.

peter tseng   1:03:30
OK.
Thank you.

Ginnie Chan   1:03:31
You Malaysia.

peter tseng   1:03:32
So Sri Lanka would do we agree that we we have the less cat, we invite this cat into the meeting.
Hello.

Fernando Rev. Dr. Jude Nicholas Jude Nicholas   1:03:46
Yes.
Can you repeat please?

peter tseng   1:03:50
Yeah, I mean that after the we agreed that to have a next cat from Malaysia, what we are going to invite them at least one coordinator to be available in the our meeting.
Then they can have a a discussion with more clearly with us.
Is that OK for Sri Lanka?

Fernando Rev. Dr. Jude Nicholas Jude Nicholas   1:04:18
I think I'm also of the same opinion.

peter tseng   1:04:23
OK.
Thank you.
Is Indonesia here?
I think they are absent.
How about Taiwan?
Do you have other opinion?
I what?
Either.
Paper.

楊貞娟   1:04:52
That one?
No problem.

peter tseng   1:04:55
No problem.
OK.
Thank you.
So we go the number 6, item 6, we are going to have a financial report presentation and then umm maybe it's some kind of a recommendation of the proposal and after that, she said Shuman presentation.

Ginnie Chan   1:09:21
No, I haven't got it.
The Taiwan that version.

peter tseng   1:09:24
Well, I don't know if I I don't know why, if issues it should be the everybody should have this this meaning meeting minutes, right.

Ginnie Chan   1:09:32
You mean the sign?

peter tseng   1:09:32
OK, never mind.

Colin & Madelene Lauw   1:09:32
Yeah.
Yeah. OK.

peter tseng   1:09:33
I will send it later.

Ginnie Chan   1:09:33
The sign 1 right.

peter tseng   1:09:35
Yeah, I will send you later.

Colin & Madelene Lauw   1:09:38
OK.
OK.

peter tseng   1:09:38
Sure.

Colin & Madelene Lauw   1:09:38
Can I think that we blame it on COVID because yeah, kovit, bro.

peter tseng   1:09:39
So we so if if we. Yeah.
Yeah.
Why is it better to to know right now, right?

Colin & Madelene Lauw   1:09:46
OK. OK.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Yeah.
OK.

peter tseng   1:09:50
So everybody got this minutes, then we can we can know.

Colin & Madelene Lauw   1:09:50
Thank you.
Thank you.

peter tseng   1:09:56
We can understand the what, what is going to happen and now it is.
Anything happened or anything have has been achieved.
OK.
And about 10:15 to 11:30, that's a constitution.
An amendment approval, so later I think later we were try to explain them some amendment of the Constitution and then yeah, but everybody's agree and then we can just sign the report.
The Constitution on this meeting, so we we hope that we don't spend so much time to review them and detailed discussion is that OK for you everybody.

Colin & Madelene Lauw   1:10:53
Yes, OK, yes, yes.

peter tseng   1:10:56
OK, so the the last one is the recommendation from NCT meeting and then we can uh, let nescit now take over this recommendation.
That would be easier for them.
Why?
So it's the process of the entity meeting on the day four.
So if you have any concern or any question, I think the priest review that the agenda I sent it to you on WhatsApp group, OK.
So next one, we're going to have a a discussion about the Constitution amendment.
So he said, everybody can see the PowerPoint file, Frank.

聰 劉   1:12:24
Yes.

peter tseng   1:12:25
OK, so I think that the.
The most important one is the the modification, the change of the nation now.
OK, let me.
Have this one or bigger.
Keep please look at this, this slide.
We are going to change the the the name of the a country.
Ohh to the the countries over this could easiest sticker province or dialysis and that's a definition of the Member I think.
Basically, it's the kind of a a different name of the of the members. So.
We are going to change the every every words in the Constitution about the Members definition.
So is that OK for you?
So if you need further.
Explanation.
I think the according can help me to do that because the he spent so much time to discuss with Joyce about this kind of of change.
I think that there's so many work involved, especially concerned about the low, low, low term term of law.

Colin & Madelene Lauw   1:14:56
Yeah.
Yeah, cat.
Get us Singapore if we can help with the English, because the Constitution is in English, so I'm not a lawyer.
So but Joyce, our national coordinator, Emmanuel and Joyce Joyce is a lawyer.
So Joyce will a lot to draft this.
And so she said, you should have a appendix, a new appendix one, and wish you define what is member so that in the normal in the main document, you just say member and Member, we will know is defined as these three things are.
And either of these three things, it can be country.
It can be it classical province, which is what a Hong Kong and Taiwan suggested, and it can be dialysis.
So then she also said is it, is it listed anywhere?
What is what?
What the Members first said no, the old constitution did not have to list anything about who are the members.
So she said, just list to be more certain than every time you have a new member.
If you have a new Member, then you just add really simple.
It's a very simple change in the Constitution, no problem.
So I we have written down this Members.
So you notice the last one is South Korea.
That's because when I look at the old, old documents, South Korea, which was original member, but of course now we lost contact with them.
But, but they're quite big.
So. So.
Yeah, we can decide to to take them out of the the list or we can just say that they are still the family member, but we have not contacted, not not been able to contact our family member yet.
So it's up to us what we want to do.
Uh, but yeah, we want to have this we think is good to have the appendix and to list the countries, NOT countries resist the Members.
And now by Hong Kong is not doesn't have to say that it's it's a country.
It's not a country like it is just the name of the member is called choice Hong Kong.
What is choice?
Hong Kong it could be a country because the province or diocese, so you know, if you had to explain itself, you'll say, yeah, we're just a.
But that's a classical province member, yeah.

peter tseng   1:17:34
OK.
Thank you, Corinne.
So is everybody career?
OK, then another the issue is a role of the Council members.
So I think that we shared another PowerPoint.

Colin & Madelene Lauw   1:17:55
That.
Sorry the I did clear about the other one.
The second PowerPoint in the second slide.
What about nation?
Yeah.
So, so nation and country we must remove from the Constitution but national remove so.
But once we remove national, then for for choice Asia, we cannot say national coordinator for choice issue only.
So you imagine in choice Asia conference we cannot say NCD because then all the NCT's are must be national coordinator.
They're Hong Kong.
Say we are not national.
Then you know Taiwan also.
Yeah, so.
You you have to have a different.
A description, but yes, if you are having your own national meeting like Choice Malaysia has national meeting choice.
Malaysia has is own constitution, so try Malaysia can say this is my national coordinator isn't that's fine right?
Because in your own country you can say national coordinator, no one will say you are wrong.
No other country will question you, but in a international.
International platform like Choice Asia Choice Asia conference you, you cannot say national coordinator.
So in the same way when when when choice Malaysia host your program cannot say NCT meeting, you have to say something else.
Yeah.
So that everyone is comfortable.
I I'm not attending the national coordinator meeting.
Yeah.
Yeah, so.

Ginnie Chan   1:19:50
Yeah.
Ah, sorry, I want to add some additional because I I just think about the our rundown for the three days and then because it has like country report Hong Kong and then it is not appropriate for this wordings for us and also the NCT report.

Colin & Madelene Lauw   1:20:07
Yeah.

Ginnie Chan   1:20:16
Uh, and this?

Colin & Madelene Lauw   1:20:18
OK, remember it.

Ginnie Chan   1:20:19
So I I was I think we need a new name and you.

Colin & Madelene Lauw   1:20:21
And therefore single.

office cac   1:20:24
Yeah, so please suggest.
What?
What should I put over there?

Colin & Madelene Lauw   1:20:28
This is.

office cac   1:20:31
The NOT meeting.
What should we are calling you?
Say it cannot use the words entity meeting, right?
So what is the best words to use across town meeting or?

Colin & Madelene Lauw   1:20:43
The MCT is it very funny member coordinating MCT meeting.

peter tseng   1:20:43
What we.

Colin & Madelene Lauw   1:20:49
OK, see that.
What, MCP.

office cac   1:20:54
Yeah.

Colin & Madelene Lauw   1:20:55
I I said I hoped that national coordinating team NCT become MCT.
This is the simplest way, but I don't know whether you're say there's very funny, but you only need to use it in the, but in the minutes of the meeting or in the agenda of CSE.
Then then for for Virginia?
Yeah, I think if you just call it choice, Hong Kong report can right if you say and and these are the Members reports in this in this in this iCloud drive then Members report OK, no problem.
All kinds of members, right?
Different, different kind of members.

Ginnie Chan   1:21:37
Yeah, I think Members report will be better and then I'm.

Colin & Madelene Lauw   1:21:37
This is the report.
Yeah.

Ginnie Chan   1:21:41
I'm I I'm I have to state that it's Hong Kong.
Call my China, Hong Kong, China because.

Colin & Madelene Lauw   1:21:49
Hong Kong.

Ginnie Chan   1:21:51
Comma and then China.

Colin & Madelene Lauw   1:21:53
Ohh.

Ginnie Chan   1:21:54
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that it.
It is not it it.
It is not appropriate to.
No, it is not illegal to just write Hong Kong in an international conference.
I'm really sorry about it.

peter tseng   1:22:06
Here.
Yeah.
Yeah, Judy.
Well, I think that well, it's my responsibility to explain to the observers from China, I think that I can speak Mandarin with them.
So it's better to explain the our position and our history and then how come we have this kind of terminology.

Ginnie Chan   1:22:31
Yeah, because we have the new law in Hong Kong, you know, then you know, security law.

peter tseng   1:22:32
Yeah.
Yeah, that's why I see.
That's why I think I I would explain to them.

Ginnie Chan   1:22:37
Yeah, it is.

peter tseng   1:22:39
Yeah.
OK, before the conference.

Ginnie Chan   1:22:39
Thank you.
So it is small safe for us to change it.

peter tseng   1:22:44
Yeah, that's right.

Ginnie Chan   1:22:44
Yeah.

peter tseng   1:22:45
That's right.

Ginnie Chan   1:22:45
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Thank you.

peter tseng   1:22:46
Well, I don't.

Ginnie Chan   1:22:47
Thank you.

peter tseng   1:22:48
I know, I know, this is this is not so.
So this is not comfortable, you know, because we are talking about political issue in the conference.

Ginnie Chan   1:22:58
Yeah, I am so sorry.

peter tseng   1:22:58
So I will try to to ask them not to mention about something about the political things.

Ginnie Chan   1:23:05
Oh, thank you.
Thank you.

peter tseng   1:23:06
Yeah.

Ginnie Chan   1:23:06
Thank you so.

peter tseng   1:23:07
We just, you know, we just a brother and sister in the in the crash.
So I think we just focus on the the choice community and and you know the communion between the our community and not not to just bring in the political issue here.

Ginnie Chan   1:23:12
Yeah.

peter tseng   1:23:27
So yeah.

Ginnie Chan   1:23:27
Yeah, that crystals vivid.

peter tseng   1:23:30
Yeah, that's right.
So I think when I will, I will beat them, I will meet with them and explain that and to try to the talk to them.

Ginnie Chan   1:23:36
Yeah.
Thank you so much.
Yeah.
Thank you.

peter tseng   1:23:41
So don't worry about that.

Colin & Madelene Lauw   1:23:42
Yeah.
Because, OK, so thanks.
Thanks beautiful handling this because then if Hong Kong has called self choice, Hong Kong comma China, then the China observers has to be choice something comma China.
Is that right?

Ginnie Chan   1:23:58
No.

Colin & Madelene Lauw   1:23:58
I don't know.

Ginnie Chan   1:23:58
If that, I don't think so.

Colin & Madelene Lauw   1:24:00
Right.

Ginnie Chan   1:24:01
Because actually how?

peter tseng   1:24:01
That's all Company day.

Ginnie Chan   1:24:03
Because Hong Kong is a special administration region, so so we have to do it like this.

Colin & Madelene Lauw   1:24:03
All.
Ohh, OK OK, OK.
Ohh.

Ginnie Chan   1:24:11
This is our our choice.
Praise our father.
It as Father Steven he he actually he studied the the the the law of the the the Court the like the marriage code I I don't know how to say in in yeah and then and then he found out this we have to use Hong Kong comma and China and then but in China if for them I think in general they are national they are national so it's OK they are country.

office cac   1:24:45
So no need to to have like Republic of China or just China.

Colin & Madelene Lauw   1:24:52
That's even more.

office cac   1:24:53
So locally, yeah.

Colin & Madelene Lauw   1:24:54
Yeah, I don't.
I think done because that then you also you are the what?

office cac   1:24:57
OK.

Colin & Madelene Lauw   1:24:59
What of Malaysia?
So so I think, yeah, yeah.

office cac   1:25:01
OK, so is this just China?
Yeah.
So OK, another question for Taiwan.

peter tseng   1:25:04
Yeah, China is OK.
Yeah, China is OK. Yeah.

office cac   1:25:08
Taiwan, you should put Roc, Taiwan or just Taiwan.

peter tseng   1:25:12
Well, that that's this.
I think the the either one is OK, but Taiwan is simple right?
I think I don't think it is so complicated.
Just have so many trouble to discuss that.
Yeah, I think that's a each.
I think he's a personal issue.
I would.
I would rather think it's a personal issue, so if we show respect to the China observers in the events and to explain what are we going to do in the conference and the way we don't hope to bring in the political issue here, as you know, they can understand and respect the conference, right?

FAVOR Lin   1:25:40
Speak.

peter tseng   1:25:57
It's only the respect or not, but we show them the we understand the this kind of issue and that we don't want to have some documents or waste time to argue about this.
Check the name of the country, the name of the special region, and I think that's a it's not the the the church way.
I think so.
Yeah, I I will try to to get the consensus on this point with them.
So don't worry about that, OK?

office cac   1:26:34
OK, sure.
So come back to the NOT meetings, right?

peter tseng   1:26:35
Yeah.

office cac   1:26:37
So should we change to Member coordinating team or?

peter tseng   1:26:37
Yeah.
Yeah, that's right.
That's right.
Sure.
Sure. Please.

office cac   1:26:45
OK, so NOT meeting.
I will change to MCT meeting.
I remember calling team OK.

peter tseng   1:26:50
Yeah, that's right.
Yeah, yeah, yes.

Ginnie Chan   1:26:53
Thank you.

office cac   1:26:55
Right.

peter tseng   1:26:57
So is anything that from calling you you want to to give more explanation?

Colin & Madelene Lauw   1:27:05
Yes.

peter tseng   1:27:06
OK, OK.

Colin & Madelene Lauw   1:27:07
No. OK.

peter tseng   1:27:08
So the next thing is that we are going to have a the PowerPoint of a Council member.

office cac   1:27:34
Sorry, I while waiting for Peter.
I have another questions just saying that not to use the country report right so called country report.
So what?
What should we use?

peter tseng   1:27:44
Member report.

Ginnie Chan   1:27:44
Maybe it's just yeah.

office cac   1:27:45
Member report.
OK, right. Thanks.

peter tseng   1:27:46
Yeah.

Emmanuel Tan   1:27:59
Sorry, this is Emmanuel here.
So just to All also which is why earlier on when, when, when the proposed change in the appendix where we list down the Members and then you write down whether you're choosing about choice Malaysia, that's where I think then when we write minutes, we refer to that list because whichever is a Member will then say this is how I want to be referred to.
So whether your choice I was choice Hong Kong, chicoma China.
You write it there and then after that, whoever is taking minutes.
I'm trying to make reference to another country or another member they refer to that list right?
And he said this is this is. Yeah.
So that's that's the way we we propose to to avoid saying the the naming the wrong for the at that point in time, right? Yeah.

peter tseng   1:29:51
But.

Colin & Madelene Lauw   1:30:09
He told me.
I just give some a little bit of history about this.

peter tseng   1:30:12
OK.
OK. Please.

Colin & Madelene Lauw   1:30:15
Yeah.
So I.
Because we have to revise this.
So actually?
Peter asked me to look at it.
Say it looks very.
A restraining.
So is it what?
Why is it that only cat, cat only talk to Council member?
He said.
Well, I cannot.
Can't talk directly to national calling member coordinators.
So I said long time ago we said that whenever there is a cat meeting with different member countries or provinces.
They had to meet physically and so, for example, a few times they meet in Singapore in Choice House in in Singapore because Singapore is the easiest place to come and then to go back home.
So they they then in then they cat must also pay the airfare, pay for them to fly to Singapore to meet, and then cat will pay.

peter tseng   1:31:04
Like.

Colin & Madelene Lauw   1:31:16
Also, Choice House a small amount of money just for, you know, for the to house the the Members.
So the national coordinator say we have no time to to, to, to go to Singapore, to we have so much to do.
We are running the country.
We are so in the end we said, OK, don't worry.
We have foreign affairs.
We have Council Rep these are these people should be experienced people.
Maybe in the past they are coordinator or ohh very senior people and then and also they must have they they know about choice Asia maybe they must attend choice a conference one or two times at least you know so they they understand choice issue so then that everybody agree.
OK.
Thank you very much.
We will every time I want to have a meeting, we will send our a Council Rep to to Singapore or to wherever to have the meeting.
So there was even one time, I think in Indonesia we we even went to visit Indonesia because Indonesia invited us to see the retreat house where they will have the next conference and and things like that.
So uh, but can't say now is Internet.
Now everyone can meet online.
Why?
Why can I meet?
Why cannot we have a national coordinator in the chat?
So I said yeah, because the Constitution said no need.
So.
So he said, OK, can you change the Constitution?
So that's what this is all about.
We are the Members, role is about the same.
It's the same.
It's just that uh Cat says.
Can we have at least once a year like now?
Like what's happening now?
Right now, the national coordinators are meeting, right.
Everybody from all the member, all the member coordinators, you all meeting, and you, you, you don't have to depend on me to talk.
So, like Immanuel is here, a Gregory is here and sometime and yeah.
So we are just we, we, we we also represent that so, so.
So, he says, put in the put in the Constitution that actually cat should meet with the leaders once a year at least online physically.
Also possible maybe that once a year like let's say this year, this year, if if they don't want to then once a year is at the at the the conference, so something like that.
So then then that will be much better for future cat to work together.
Yeah.
To to.
Yeah, to find common challenges.
Common problems and then and then encourage the different countries to work with each other and cooperate and things like that.
So.
So that's why we changed the the the wordings for this purpose.

peter tseng   1:34:12
Yeah.
Thank you, Cody.
I think the basically the IT is the same.

Colin & Madelene Lauw   1:34:16
Yeah.

peter tseng   1:34:17
Nothing. Nothing.
Big change here.
Here just I didn't know.
Just like Korean?
Said ask cat.
Right now I feel like the there's a gap between the cat and an NCT MCT, so I think the the the main purpose of this and the management of the Constitution is too give us seven responsibility.
Ohh 40 year MCT and Council member I think.
At the same time, Peter can and communicate with one of them instead of the, but we have to communicate with Council member 1st and then Council members our next to communicate with the MCT, and that's a kind of a gap.
What I mean is that so.
I think that.
Responsibility at here is is the and.
Either revise.
The role of the Council members to the a bridge, the relationship and adversaries on between the cat and the MCT.
It is the same and then the second is facility.
The smooth transition of the information resource between care and the and the MGT.
The same and next is is assisting.
I think this is still the same.
Yeah, that you can be changed.
I didn't.
Yeah, we we have a a Korean has have a have us to consolidate so many item and into together uh before that we have a separate discretion in the Constitution and now we are grouped them together into the a more clear to understand.
So thank you, Corina.

Colin & Madelene Lauw   1:36:34
Yeah, the thank.
Thank you very much to Joyce.
This is really more about Joyce, Joyce.
Look at it and she says somebody is very confusing.
Some part is not clear enough, so actually I asked choice Malaysia what is your your constitution like?
So we use quite a lot from choice Malaysia Choice Malaysia definition of what?
The Council Member does and how to choose, the Council Member is is, is, is the best.
I think it's better we have to change our own single.
The tuition to to be more like Malaysia so.
But anyway, thanks to Malaysia also.
So some of the words we also borrow from a choice, Malaysia for this, yeah.

peter tseng   1:37:17
Yeah.
Thank you, Malaysia and uh, so are we going to have a chance to meet Joyce in the conference?

Colin & Madelene Lauw   1:37:26
Yes, yes.
And it's Emmanuel is here.
But yeah, Joyce couldn't make it today.
But Immanuel is here.
But yeah, Joyce and Manuel are coming, yes.

peter tseng   1:37:35
OK, that's great.

Emmanuel Tan   1:37:37
I want to see everybody in jail.

peter tseng   1:37:39
Yeah, that's great.
So well, basically I think the everybody can review the we have the comparison of the of the items before and after in the Excel sheet.
No, would be career for everyone, but we just mentioned that here that as you big change for the Council Member, I think is a is a better for the next cat.
Yeah.
So it's anybody has any concern?
So before Council have conference, I think the well, every Council member still has changed to bring up your your concern to to the cat and we will see the.
Maybe we need if we need a more modification.
Where?
Discuss with the Singapore OK, so is there so it's OK.
And how about the the Members report?
Are we going to have a next meeting to exchange our feedback on the on the console, on the online meeting?

Colin & Madelene Lauw   1:39:01
But wait.
Sorry, Peter, just one last word about the Constitution change, because I also learned this because, you know, before I never pay too much attention too much.

peter tseng   1:39:06
OK.

Colin & Madelene Lauw   1:39:11
I never study.
The choice Asia constitution.
But Joyce was is very clear.
So she says that we cannot just, at least according to the Constitution, we cannot just agree to change the Constitution via online meeting.
You say in the in the actual constitution it says that you will finalize.
You'll finally sign.
Everyone must sign, physically sign and and physically be present at a meeting and then sign to change this Constitution, because this is not like minutes, minutes or meeting is just is not so important is a document, but not so important.
So you can always say I sign online and then there's confirm, but they said for Constitution is much more important document.
So you must you must be most, I don't know, confirm it in the more serious ways.
So it means you must meet physical meeting, then sign with a signature at the meeting and find so.
So that's why we can say, yes, we agree.
But finally, in October in KL, we must say.
No problem, no questions.
She's.
This is the final change.
So like Hong Kong wants some change.
So we change, we change a little bit, maybe Indonesia one, some change we changed a little bit and then we say OK, everybody confirm everybody then confirm at the physical meeting and then at the end of the meeting, I think cat will or the Secretary will ask us to sign and then that will change the Constitution for the choice Asia Constitution.
Yeah.
So that's the that's the procedure I understand now.

peter tseng   1:40:54
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, I agree.
Thank you, Corinne.
Well, you you maybe we can button you formally that I think the some kind of like a low low item they will a reader changes three times right ask the first time agree second time do you agree the third time do you agree?
I think that, well, we can take that away.
Yeah, I think is almost here is there.

Ginnie Chan   1:41:27
I have one more question.
Sorry, will that be a national?

peter tseng   1:41:29
OK.

Ginnie Chan   1:41:33
Because since we decide not to give at the is it official reports in the meeting, right.
So we will exchange ideas, we will exchange the reports before in advance.
So are there any templates for us?
Because I remember in in the past, every time the the I I I forgot his cat or host country they will send a template.
So what?
What we need to include in the report?
What?
What?
What questions do you ask?
Or or or or the the one we answered is already the national report.
No, no, sorry, the Members report.

peter tseng   1:42:19
No.
Yeah.
Let me confirm that I think you know we are going to have a next meeting, Anna, meeting Exchange Hour feedback on the A Members report.
Then we have a chance to we have a chance.
To spend a little more time to discuss the national report and that would be easier for you.
One, yeah, because we don't have to prepare the some, some kind of you set the template.
We just in the free format to ask question and then the to the each country can give their answers is that there would be a noisy for us.
OK.
Jenny, you know, would be easier.
OK.
So yeah, but because I think that just like a Korean said earlier, but we don't have much time to in the conference.
So we if we uh spend so much time in the presentation and then we don't have time to ask and get an answer.
So hopefully I think the everybody agree.
Then we can have a another meeting on the next month, about a year, about a members of the pool.
Do we think that it is necessary?
Everybody.

Colin & Madelene Lauw   1:43:59
Yeah, I think it is necessary for us as well as our MCT to really go through each countries of reports.
Before and and then to have the online meeting is useful because then we can maybe propose, let's say, just maybe four, that there could be just four or five like key umm topics.
You know that certain countries view they need or they can lead some discussion on we, I we use we call it breakout rooms and break out sessions, right.

peter tseng   1:44:42
Yeah, that's right, you know.

Colin & Madelene Lauw   1:44:44
We had it in Hong Kong, Hong Kong time and then some of like like Singapore we will say OK if we send two representatives you go and listen to this topic, then another three representatives please go and listen to what like, for example, Sri Lanka is sharing or is leading that in that room.
Just go, go and listen to it first.
So it is more a proactive way and I think at least the delegates who are coming or observers, they will, they will learn something rather than to just sit and you know listen to every country just reporting what is in the PowerPoint slide.
So but before we get to that, we need to.
Umm, uh, we we need to make sure our member country read the everybody's reports.
Yeah.
And then have the online meeting before October.

peter tseng   1:45:45
OK.
Thank you, baby.

Colin & Madelene Lauw   1:45:46
Thank you.

peter tseng   1:45:47
So can we decide the time?
The day and the time.
So it was if it is in the West and there's still the same the Wednesday night.
So how about the you've Engage of the 18th of the of the September?
Which way is better for you?
He events of September or 18th of the September.

Colin & Madelene Lauw   1:46:20
Decoding is calling you little workshop.

Emmanuel Tan   1:46:32
Maybe.
Ohh October will be better because.
September.

Colin & Madelene Lauw   1:46:36
No, no.

Emmanuel Tan   1:46:37
Sorry sorry.
Which day again 11?

Colin & Madelene Lauw   1:46:40
Sorry, September 11 Emmanuel.

peter tseng   1:46:43
September 11 is that OK for everybody?

Ginnie Chan   1:46:48
Yeah.

office cac   1:46:49
Yep, I think better to do it as in September.
You know, if you have something else to to discuss, then we can maybe have another meeting.

Ginnie Chan   1:46:53
Early September.

Emmanuel Tan   1:46:54
OK.

office cac   1:46:57
I want to show right so yeah.

peter tseng   1:46:58
Yeah.
OK, so everybody agreed on this.
The events of the September right.

Colin & Madelene Lauw   1:47:08
Or Emmanuel, are you a Greg?
Are you OK for September 11?

Emmanuel Tan   1:47:10
Yes, OK.
11 is fine, yeah.

Colin & Madelene Lauw   1:47:15
OK.

peter tseng   1:47:20
OK, OK.
So that's it.

Colin & Madelene Lauw   1:47:23
OK.

peter tseng   1:47:24
He's now we are going to.
I've finished the meeting.
Is there any topic you want to talk?

Osmand Fernando   1:47:30
OK.

peter tseng   1:47:34
Anybody want to talk?

office cac   1:47:34
Up.
Yep.

Osmand Fernando   1:47:37
September, September 11, Sri Lanka, OK.

peter tseng   1:47:40
OK.
Thank you.
Thank you.

office cac   1:47:44
OK, so for me I have a few questions.
The first thing is so are we going to have the breakout room for the Members report?
So there's like no more kind of like member report, right?
It's kind of like, you know, we directly separate to break up room, right.

peter tseng   1:48:00
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
Yeah, I think that that's a we we will decide a few topics in the next online meeting and then the we will yeah ask montier or maybe we can decide which country is better for this this topic to to present this topic.

Colin & Madelene Lauw   1:48:22
Yeah.
Give, give.

peter tseng   1:48:24
OK.

Colin & Madelene Lauw   1:48:24
He's pretty good.

office cac   1:48:24
So, so so meaning that that that the country also will have like maybe a 10 to 20 minutes presentation then after that all the Members will go to the breakout room or it will directly go to the breakup room, why is the floor?

Colin & Madelene Lauw   1:48:25
At least one hour.

peter tseng   1:48:25
In the previous session.
Well, I think that it it.
Yeah, it depends on everybody I buy, but I would recommend that if if we are going to have a breakout session, then we can ask everybody choose their preferred topic, right, and go to the break up room.

Colin & Madelene Lauw   1:48:52
Yeah.

office cac   1:48:53
Mm-hmm.

Colin & Madelene Lauw   1:48:55
I think I was thinking is that Juliana, everybody will just go straight to break out room.

office cac   1:48:58
Uh-huh.

Colin & Madelene Lauw   1:49:02
No, no need to listen to like member reports at this during October already.

peter tseng   1:49:02
Yeah.

Colin & Madelene Lauw   1:49:11
So I think yeah.

office cac   1:49:11
OK.

Colin & Madelene Lauw   1:49:12
For a host country preparation, just combine the two.
I notice you have two by two that the Member reports right that country reports.
So you just combine the two.

office cac   1:49:23
Yes.

Colin & Madelene Lauw   1:49:24
So like I think choice Singapore Choice Malaysia is 1 after the another.
So you may into one hour.

office cac   1:49:28
Yeah, huh.

Colin & Madelene Lauw   1:49:30
So for that one hour, we call it breakout #1 break out #1 maybe has two sessions.
Uh.

office cac   1:49:38
Mm-hmm.

Colin & Madelene Lauw   1:49:39
Maybe.
Maybe.
I'm not sure though, but then when you say brick and no one, then we will have signed up beforehand to say I want to attend the Singapore when I want to attend the then it will be in different rooms.

office cac   1:49:50
OK, OK, got it.

Colin & Madelene Lauw   1:49:51
Yeah, yeah.

office cac   1:49:52
Got it.
So many like from Malaysia and Singapore are we combine it to 1 section.
So within that one hour, they can choose either go to Singapore or go to Malaysia, right?

Colin & Madelene Lauw   1:50:01
It it could be, but let let cat decide.

office cac   1:50:03
Ohh.

Colin & Madelene Lauw   1:50:04
Because once Cat knows what are the different topics can may say OK Singapore break out combined with Sri Lanka break out.
Do you know I'm saying that so?
But but all I'm saying is that I see that you have Singapore and Malaysia in one.
So you just now that means you have one hour slot, so you call that breakout session number one.
Then maybe there's another one where you have two countries.
So now because I know two whether that breakout session is Malaysia and Singapore, choose between Malaysia and Singapore, then one you let Cat arranged topic.
Yeah, but, but, but but yes.

office cac   1:50:36
OK, sure.
Because we are going to do, no, we are going to print the booklet, right?
The agenda into the booklet so we need that information as soon as possible, right?
Which which country is going to for the backup room one or backup room 2?
So, Peter, can you please let me know as soon as possible the the arrangement?

peter tseng   1:50:56
Well, well, I think they should not.

Colin & Madelene Lauw   1:50:56
Been there.

peter tseng   1:50:58
Necessary to to the to bring out the which come which Members were doing that section.

Colin & Madelene Lauw   1:50:59
Yeah.
Yeah.

peter tseng   1:51:07
Yeah, you you can just leave that topic one for the Section 1 topic or the topic two topic three and and then we announced the topic in the conference.

office cac   1:51:16
OK, OK.

Colin & Madelene Lauw   1:51:18
Yeah.

peter tseng   1:51:20
I think it's OK.

Colin & Madelene Lauw   1:51:20
That's right.

peter tseng   1:51:21
Yeah, it's OK.

Colin & Madelene Lauw   1:51:21
Yeah, otherwise you get more stressed today, Anna.

peter tseng   1:51:24
Yeah.

Colin & Madelene Lauw   1:51:24
Because why I cannot give you then like, but at least now mind your your online version if you want to, you can say please to see the online because online whether can be immediate, right.

office cac   1:51:24
Yeah, true.

Colin & Madelene Lauw   1:51:35
Yeah.
Yeah, but but the the printer version got problem is only say breakout session one breakout session two then OK never mind.

office cac   1:51:36
Yes, that's good idea.

Colin & Madelene Lauw   1:51:43
The people know that.

office cac   1:51:43
Ohh.

Colin & Madelene Lauw   1:51:44
OK, there are two or three breakout sessions, one hour, one hour, 1 hour.
But I don't know what they are.
Never mind.
Later you will know.
So yeah, later maybe a few days before the conference, you can send a soft copy on the day itself.
Yeah.
Yeah, but don't stress yourself.

office cac   1:52:00
Uh, OK, sure.

Colin & Madelene Lauw   1:52:02
You know you're gonna friend already.

office cac   1:52:02
OK, got it.

Colin & Madelene Lauw   1:52:03
I understand you're gonna print.
I understand that it's stressful.

office cac   1:52:07
Hmm.

peter tseng   1:52:07
Now we're gonna have a we can have a more flexibility.

office cac   1:52:07
OK, got it.

peter tseng   1:52:10
Alright, I think it's OK.

Colin & Madelene Lauw   1:52:12
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

peter tseng   1:52:13
Yeah.

office cac   1:52:14
Alright. Got it.

peter tseng   1:52:14
OK, OK.

office cac   1:52:15
Yeah.

peter tseng   1:52:16
Is anybody OK? OK.

office cac   1:52:16
So.
So my second, yeah, my second question is uh, China, right?
Because China is attending the choice Taiwan, so this round in Malaysia, there they have attended second time.
So are they going to be the custom member of choice, or is it that there is 2 times right at least to attend the CAC?

peter tseng   1:52:39
You know, I I don't think there.
Yeah.
Going to to this application in this conference, they are just observers.

office cac   1:52:46
Ohh, OK OK got it.

peter tseng   1:52:50
OK.
Any issue?

Colin & Madelene Lauw   1:52:54
But that's the that's does cat want to invite them?
Because you can't invite them then I think, uh, the MCT's, the coordinating team leaders must say yes.
Can we support because we know that the first time three years in in, in, in Taiwan, we said you have to wait one time.
So now if so, even if they are not not applying, you must say we would like to welcome you and hope that you can quickly apply.
Do you want that?
Or you say no, no, no.
There's some problems that you don't want to talk about that it is maybe someone who knows you are a favor, who knows a bit more can just say, OK, no need, no need, because that's let them be observer.
So it's up to you.
You know you. Yeah.

peter tseng   1:53:43
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Well, I think I think that we have a discussion real real, yeah.
In the and I think that, uh, yeah, we already already asked the opinion.

Colin & Madelene Lauw   1:53:52
Let them be observer.
Don't.
Don't invite them. Don't.

peter tseng   1:53:58
OK umm so any issue any more issue?

Colin & Madelene Lauw   1:53:58
OK.
OK. OK.

Frank   1:54:05
I I have a question with regarding the breakout session on different topics.
Uh, I will be able to, you know, to get involved on all of the topics with within the breaking up a session or is it just a certain certain breakout rooms or will only be joining by other groups and we are not going to involve how, how is it going to involve or so?

Ginnie Chan   1:54:35
I think it's like last time in Hong Kong.
We you sign up and then you just go to one or two particular one.
But can we do the recording so that, yeah, maybe in the future, if someone wants to have, they are interested in others.
They can also have a look.
Is it possible to have to recording?

office cac   1:54:58
OK.
We'll try our best to set up that.

peter tseng   1:55:02
Thank you.
Thank you, Juliana.

Frank   1:55:03
Uh, I'm sorry, this is just my this is just my opinion I'm with regarding the breaking the breakout rooms to benefits because we don't have enough time also to benefits.

Ginnie Chan   1:55:04
Thank you.

Frank   1:55:15
So that to to benefit all of the country at the same time, maybe we can just have one topic and then we discuss it on that particular night or maybe 2 topics we don't have to go through all so that everybody can participate.
Everybody can get all the whatever information and regarding off the topics.

peter tseng   1:55:40
Done, yeah.
Anybody has a feedback?

Emmanuel Tan   1:55:51
Maybe only All say common topics that that is repeated across most members.

Frank   1:55:51
Yeah.

Emmanuel Tan   1:55:58
Uh report, right?
So example maybe how do you reach out to the young or whatever and maybe that the comment of it then you can, but what you suggest where more people come to that if not if it's if it's subtopic then you would need different breakout rooms, but unless it's a comment update that everyone is is agreeing on that means maybe the next meeting I mean after we agree this topic is very important lever, is it the logical point or is it a a how to reach out for being relevant then maybe that's something that we can all.
Do together, but if not then I think it's based on the interest because some topics may not apply to some countries or may not be so.
Keep some Members may not be so keen on certain topics.

peter tseng   1:56:48
Well, I think I think in the next online meeting, we can still have more discussion about the arrangement.
I think we still have time.
And yeah, he said.
Is that OK to you?
Drink.

Frank   1:57:05
Yeah, yeah, should be.
I should be OK.
I just, you know, I just are curious on if if I want to join the other you know because if we have to host one of the session for the breaking after the breakup session you know like how am I going to?
Join the other session like that because.
To have this online meeting on on session, I think it will take some time so I I I I just don't know how it's going to benefit everybody at the same time or maybe if we have a, if we have a report on based on that particular topic then it will be helpful.
If we can just forward it to every country so that they have a references, you know for their.
For your information that they maybe can share with their members in their country.

peter tseng   1:58:09
Yeah.
You're not.
Yeah.
You.
You, if we can have a.
Yeah, that's right.
Yeah.
You again have a some kind of a, uh, a brief, a brief report or the brief contents of the of the breakout session.
I think it would be a more convenient for everybody to decide if this interesting to them or not, so I don't know if it is difficult for us to after the next online meeting.
Then we decide which country which Member will take uh, which topic and the baby.
They can send us some kind of brief.
Is that would be a, a a better way would be a uh benefit for us.
Maybe we can discuss the the better way in the next meeting.
Yeah.
Yeah, because the we we still we can have some kind of a a discussion of thing over after tonight and then the on this September meeting good job Kevin have more discussion on the sure.

Frank   1:59:17
OK.
OK.

peter tseng   1:59:36
OK.

Frank   1:59:36
And I think I I also would like to extend a genius question.
Earlier on, the templates of the reports, uh, I can we have the templates on paper report so that we can refer we can refer to it before we ask any question because As for the video.
Umm, I'm OK with you too.
You know, it's just that if we have something to refer to on paper, it will be easier.
You know something that we can keep for future reference.

peter tseng   2:00:08
No. OK.

Ginnie Chan   2:00:09
Either PowerPoint is it PowerPoint, it's better PowerPoint or or if or documents is OK, I think, and I think PowerPoint is easier for you.
Are you going to show the video on the CAC during the CAC?
No, right.
Yes you will.

peter tseng   2:00:34
Yeah, Julianne, this is that, OK.

Ginnie Chan   2:00:38
No, I mean, I mean so umm the video is actually for us to send to other other members in like in in my place, right?
So that they they can, they can see they can watch.

office cac   2:00:52
OK.
And can all all we upload the video into our website so that everyone can go into the website and have a look?

Ginnie Chan   2:00:55
I don't know the videos using for.

office cac   2:01:02
What do you all think?
Is that OK?

Frank   2:01:08
I'm OK with it.

Ginnie Chan   2:01:08
That would be a the Members report, right?

office cac   2:01:13
Yep, but I'm not too sure whether is it because it's maybe we'll open up to all other non choices or so, right?

Colin & Madelene Lauw   2:01:14
And that.

office cac   2:01:22
Maybe there's a a rest there.

Ginnie Chan   2:01:25
I I don't.
I think it's not appropriate to give out the information of each and you.

Colin & Madelene Lauw   2:01:27
No.

Osmand Fernando   2:01:33
One yeah, no.

office cac   2:01:34
Yeah.
So in that case then maybe uploading to the website is not, it's not suitable, right?

peter tseng   2:01:40
OK, Jeannie, I beg your pardon.
Are you are you saying that?
Ohh which still have some kind of a template for the for our Member report.

Ginnie Chan   2:01:56
Ah.

peter tseng   2:01:56
We all.
We already have video, right?

Ginnie Chan   2:02:03
OK, that's it.
I I I actually don't understand the the use of the videos and then where where should I send to my members or how my other choices in Hong Kong or the the the MCT for them to read through to watch or because actually now at this moment all the Members report or or the OR the videos are only sharing among the council members not not the MCT.
And then we can't represent all of them.
So I think they also need to know or they need to watch.
Should we also send the videos to them or or I don't actually know the use of it?
Why?
Why we need to record the videos?

peter tseng   2:02:59
Why?
It's depend on you.
I think that the the initially the this this video is.
For every members, uh, I think they, if I'm the point of view or from Kit, I think you will be more easier to have.
Uh MCT to to doing to do some kind of chaining?
Some kind of learning of the sharing between your community members.
So if you think that someone he's a proper to read this this video of this file because it's maybe it is so so difficult for them, maybe it is not so interesting for them.
Yeah, you see, so you have to decide which one is better, which person is better to to reach video to, to share, to talk with you.
Does your decision not not kettle of what I think is is better for you to to understand the contents of video and bring up your question about it?
For example, if you think that there's some kind of interesting of some kind of a.
Missed understand understanding from the Taiwanese report or the militias report and.
But it's better for you to bring up.
You were concerned or you were question before the conference.
If you bring this question to conference, that will be no time for this, because everybody's busy want to learn from something and we don't have much time.

Ginnie Chan   2:04:51
Yeah, I understand.
I understand we.
We should meet the have new learnings, so I I'll, I'll I.
I haven't sent to all our Members yet in Hong Kong, so I will send all our paperwork or or the documents to them.
Is it like this I I I I just ask is is like I just a little bit confused.

peter tseng   2:05:15
Yeah.
I I yeah, because the for for example Taiwan, we have a a few local uh coordinators in a different area.
So we just invite a local coordinators to watch the video to exchange the idea to learn something from video, and then the national, I mean the the member coordinators.
We ask opinions from the local coordinators.
Any question and any feedback and then and then the member coordinators can bring up their questions and the next meeting because we are going to discuss the mission of Members report on the next meeting, right.

Ginnie Chan   2:06:09
I understand.
But I mean, in the past CAC right, not only the delegates, also the observers, they are also sitting there and then they they they will listen to the report.
I understand that now that we want to change, we want to have new learnings.
So we have figured out rooms, but for the observers now it means that not all the delegates are not the observers.
They will go through or they can't.
They can't learn from all countries.
So I just wonder, so should we also can we can we because it is a the property or or or the information from all other countries or Members so can can we send to the the observers or the delegates who have already?

Colin & Madelene Lauw   2:07:01
And then speak.

Ginnie Chan   2:07:08
Yeah.

Colin & Madelene Lauw   2:07:08
Sign up for the conflict.

Ginnie Chan   2:07:09
Registered sign up for the conference so that because I think the observer may be they, they will be, they are interested in helping in choice.
So can we do that?

peter tseng   2:07:22
Sure, sure.
I think we we we don't have any arguments here, but yeah, yeah.

Colin & Madelene Lauw   2:07:27
Yeah.
Agree.
You can't.
Yeah, no problem that.
That's what we intend to do.

peter tseng   2:07:32
Yeah.

Colin & Madelene Lauw   2:07:33
So right, I mean, we would let the the confirm list of delegates attending they they should get a a glance or read you know different countries, the status of where each country's choice of activity level is at. Right.
Yeah.
And they're already interested in going.
So I'm quite sure we will be quite open to sharing that report with that, that group of people, yeah.

Ginnie Chan   2:08:01
